We recruited the participants according to the results of the pilot survey. We interviewed users who fit the characteristics of FunNow’s target population.

User value:</b><br>⁃ Users are mainly care about the price, promotion and reviews.<br>⁃ When viewing the stores, users are mainly worry about the “quality and safety of the store” and “the consistency of pictures and physical object”.<br>⁃ Users want multiple choices of filters. The filtering factors that most users want are “reviews”, “average consumption,” “store ranking”, “attendance time” and “the location of the store”.<br>⁃ More than 60% users are willing to choose off-peak hours if there is promotion at that time.<br>⁃ More than 60% users would like to contact the store directly through the FunNow app.</p>

			<div class="head"><b>Heuristic Evaluation</b></div>
			<div class="text"><p>As FunNow launched the new version app,  we used the evaluation method outlined by Jakob Nielsen (Nielsen, 1994) to evaluate the new FunNow app. Heuristic evaluation is a design practice in which a group of usability experts evaluate software or websites in reference to standard set of usability principles or heuristics. The purpose of the exercise is to identify existing issues that violate these usability principles and come up with recommendations for how they can be fixed.</p></div>

			</div>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Focus of Evaluation</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>Our team began by identifying the key tasks that users would need to accomplish in order for the website to be successful. The booking procedure has five major sections. Our primary focus was to evaluate key workflows for these sections and identify the heuristic breaches that are critical to FunNow usability. The key sections are as following:</p><p>1. Sign up and sign in</p><p>2. Browsing, includes direct browsing, filtering browsing, keyword search</p><p>3. View the store information and add interested store into “my collection”</p><p>4. Booking, includes first time booking, booking from collected stores and continuously booking twice in the same store</p><p>5. Manage the booking history</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Individual Assessment</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>Each team member  in our four-person team individually identified heuristic breaches in all five sections of the product. In the process we also assigned a severity rating based on a 1-4 numerical scale. After identifying each problem, the evaluator reviewed the nine other heuristics to see if multiple heuristics could support the finding, which simplified consolidation later in the process. </p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Combining Results and Assessing Severity</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>Once the individual assessments were done, we met as a team to discuss our individual findings and see if we could merge similarly identified problems. In the process, we also discussed and reached a consensus on severity ratings. Finally, we decided on the findings that we would focus on based on the importance of the use case and their severity. We deep-dived into our initial individual recommendations for these findings and researched and brainstormed ideas to address these issues. The sum of findings which was scored over 3 included in the recommendations below.</p></div>

			<div class="section-title"><b>USABILITY TEST</b></div>
			<div class="head"><b>Usability Test</b></div>
			<div class="text"><p>The primary purposes of our usability testing as a means of providing a better assessment as to whether FunNow is meeting their goal of being an easy-to-use app for people of varying degrees, and to discover areas where the user experience can be improved. Methods such as heuristic evaluation and survey allowed to us to identify some major usability issues with FunNow. However, we wanted to confirm our findings and determine if additional usability problems are present. The exercise of usability testing provided qualitative data, which revealed new issues, as well as exemplified issues previously identified from heuristic evaluations and comparative analyses of FunNow. </p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Methodology</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>We started the process by designing various tasks that would help us to simulate actual app usage. We revisited our previous findings  to formulate our tasks on actual app usage pattern. To collect demographic details of users, and report issues beyond specific taskcompletion, we created post-test questionnaires. We conducted a pilot test with two users and incorporated their feedback to improve our tasks and questionnaire. Based on our target population, we recruited our test participants through various methods. In preparation for the tests, we set up a suitable environment and to make sure our devices were working. After completing all tests, our group met to discuss and analyze the findings in detail. Each of these steps is explained in detail below.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Task Designing</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>We aimed at designing tasks that would allow users to utilize multiple functionalities of FunNow. Our previous research served to be an important anchor for task generation. By revisiting our findings from the above research, we identified certain usage patterns. Most of users have the need for temporary booking and the flagship concept of FunNow is to enjoy the services after 15 minutes; hence, we designed tasks that were to take approximately two to three minutes for completion. In total, we designed 6 task scenarios and deleted one after our pilot study. FunNow is mostly used to browse and to book services; therefore, our tasks involved searching stores and booking nd every task required users to achieve different goals. Our tasks were as follows:</p><p>1. Find the store you’re interested in and add to collection</p><p>2. Search for stores that meet your requirements, including the attendance of people, time and location.</p><p>3. Finish the booking and the payment, and then booking other services at the same store.</p><p>4. Write the review for the stores you have been to.</p><p>5. Find the store you have ever been to and book the services again.</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Participants Selection</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>Our participants for the usability test were identified based on the target population of the app. Because the new version app launched recently, our participants included not only the potential user who never used FunNow before but also the users who have used the former version. A recruited questionnaire was created to help us find the participants. A total of six users responded to our usability testing requests and all of them were recruited for the usability tests. </p></div>
			<div class="sub-pic"><img src="images/funnow-usability-recruit2-06.png"></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>The Setup</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>We aimed at selecting a physical setup that would make participants feel comfortable in performing the tasks and in giving us honest feedback. We decided to conduct tests in a closed room where participant will have no disturbance while performing the tasks. A digital video camera were used to capture the actions and responses of participants during each testing session. We provided mobile phones with android or ios systems according to the user's preference. Each of the three members of our group maintained a specific role throughout the usability testing: one moderated the testing and read the introduction and each of the tasks, one administered the questionnaires, and one took notes and time.</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>Analysis</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>After the successful completion of the tests, all of our group members met and analyzed the test scripts and screen recordings. We discussed in detail the difficulties faced by participants in completing the tasks and their confusion about particular UI element.Moreover, we examined the features that users liked and disliked about the website. We also referred back to the recommendations of our past heuristic analysis and survey report in examining similar feedbacks and confirmed findings. We also discussed the challenges that the moderator and the note taker faced while conducting the tests. This discussion helped us to revisit our test design and improve tests in the future. After a thorough discussion and interpretation session, these insights are captured in our key findings and recommendations. These finding are as follows:</p></div>
