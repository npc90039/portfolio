We spent three hours at the National Palace Museum and observed directly which meant we simply watching the visitors to see how they behave and why. Each member of our four-person teams spread over in different showrooms and record the data in free-form notes.

In this interview, we were focused on finding the motivation that young people would visit the exhibition and their experience and where they get the exhibition information. The participants all aged from eighteen to twenty-five years old, including students and office workers and they all lived in Taipei. The interview script contained three sections, one was knowing their entertainment, one was asking their preference for exhibition and one was in their opinion on the National Palace Museum.</p></div>

		<div class="container-sp">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>1. Lack of diverse marketing</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>The marketing plans of National Palace Museum are not enough and not attractive. Many participants expressed that most of the exhibition information was got from friends or social media. However, they rarely receive information about the National Palace Museum. Some of them have ever seen the advertisement in the metro station, but most people said that they didn’t notice it even though they pass by every day.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>2. Serious brand story and not friendly</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>As the visitors continue to envolve and diversify, so do their expectations and needs. The museum needs to find a balance between an entertainment destination and an educational organization. However, the brand image of the National Palace Museum is too serious and lost the connection with visitors, which makes some visitors feel that history and art museums were “not for people like me.”</p></div>
			<div class="quote"><p>"The exhibits are covered by glasses boxes. It becomes a gap between me and the exhibits and looks like that the museum doesn’t trust the audiences."</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>3. The exhibits are lack of interaction and less memory points</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>The exhibits are mainly static display, and there is no design of the environmental atmosphere based on the historical background of the exhibits. Besides, reading the placards makes visitors learn about the items but the content is too much and the interaction is not enough that they are hard to immerse in.</p></div>
			<div class="quote"><p>“There are comprehensive collections in the museum, but few of them could raise me to resonate. Expect that there would be more interaction to make the audience engage in.”</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>4. The space planning is not suitable for group visiting</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>Displaying too many items makes the showroom smaller and the aisle is narrow. Especially the showrooms of the famous collection are often packed with people. It’s hard to watch the exhibits and read the placards when there’s crowded.</p></div>

			<div class="text"><p>After conducting a field study and user research, we defined the problem and tried to improve human-site interaction in the museum. Then, we started our group brainstorming phase based on the design features. The winning idea is to enable people to watch the paintings and learn the background history through an interactive rice paper window while peeping into the window to know ancients living patterns with augmented reality technology. Through common life experiences to provoke the resonate between people and paintings and give the audience much room for the imagination about antiquity life. Our designing is not displaying in the museum but spread in the city. We tried to make artworks be friendly and easy access through the public installation.</p></div>

			<div class="text"><p>The rice paper window was common in Chinese ancient and we usually found the scenes that someone tearing the window and peeping into the house are shown in Chinese chivalry drama. To make the visitors immerse themselves in the time that the painting belonged to, I utilized the rice paper window as the vibes. And the tablet which has an augmented reality program mixed the reality and ancient painting together. Looking through the window, visitors can watch that the ancients are immersed in the modern environment, and their life patterns are similar as modern.</p></div>

			<div class="head"><b>Process and Iterations </b></div>
			<div class="text"><p>To make the design fit users' needs and reach the goals that we set up, this project experienced two iterations. With each iteration, we identified new opportunities, responded to changes in the learning goal, experience goal and userf eedbacks. Each time after finishing the prototype, we would design new tasks for the prototype which aimed at aligning the design to users’ needs. </p></div>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>01 Iteration</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text">
				<p>For the first prototype, our goal was to test whether utilizing rice paper windows and AR could raise people's interest in further learning of painting. In this term, we focused on finding how this installation attracts their attention and helps them learn about the paintings. We used a laser cutting machine to make a wooden frame and stick rice paper on it and a mobile phone as the AR screen.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>01 Feedback</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>In the first test, most people like the idea and thought the interaction was interesting. But they referred that they did not dare to tear the rice paper window at first because there wasn't an indication telling them what to do and they were afraid of breaking the installation. Some tester suggested that there could be an indication tell them they can break the window or, we could tear several holes on the window in advance. Besides, testers also expressed that the mobile phone screen didn't fit the viewport. The screen should be bigger.</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>02 Iteration</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>In this term,  we tried to improve the prototype and solve all the problems in the previous tests. We designed a small placard to indicate people how to use it and tear some holes on the rice paper window in advance. To solve the problem that the mobile phone screen didn't fit the viewport, we change the mobile phone to a tablet, which screen is larger. We covered the back of the interactive installation and only the camera was revealed so that users would not be disturbed by the environment.</p></div>
		</div>	
		<div class="container">
			<div class="sub-head"><b>02 Feedback</b></div>
			<div class="sub-text"><p>The testers were satisfied with the interaction and they said that the painting we chose really interesting that they never thought their life pattern is similar to the ancients. Moreover, they also want more interaction with the painting, such as join into their conversation or taking selfie with the ancients in AR.</p></div>

			<div class="text"><p>The participants felt interested that the ancient were in the same scene with them, and the animation broke their stereotype that historical relics were serious. They enjoyed the interaction, especially they could experience peeping into the window as if they were a knight. Even though some of them have been to the National Palace Museum, most of them wanted to visit again to view the real painting we used in animation. Some of the participants pointed out that if there could be the image and description of original paintings would be better. They could get some knowledge from the interactive installation even though they didn’t have time to visit the museum.</p></div>

			<div class="section-title"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>
			<div class="head"><b>Limitation & Future Work</b></div>
			<div class="text"><p>The main limitation of our project would be that we didn’t test the prototype with actual users in the actual environments, such as MRT station. We did the test in college, where is mostly young adults who might be interested in AR. If we could test our prototype in more public space, it would have led to more discoveries on the potential problems of our prototype. Besides,  it’s hard to design an animation based on ancient paintings in limited time, as we are not an expert in this area. We used photoshop to make simple animation that the roles in painting only have small motion. We thought it would be more interesting and creative if we research the history of paintings and use the related elements to redesign the animation.</p></div>
